-- # is actually shorthand, for '|>'. There's a whole family of these:

-- |> is structure from the left, values from the right
-- <| is values from the left, structure from the right
-- |< is structure from the left, values from the left
-- >| is structure from the right, values from the right
-- |<| is values from the right, structure from both sides
-- |>| is values from the left, structure from both sides

-- < points to where the values come from, and | goes on the side where the
-- rhythmic structure comes from.
